    <p>Indian religious leader, reformer, and lawyer
    Mohandas Gandhi was an Indian revolutionary and religious leader who used his
    religious power for political and social reform. Although he held no governmental office,
    he was the main force behind the second-largest nation in the world's struggle for
    independence</p>
    <br/>
    <h2>Early years</h2>
    <p>Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi was born on October 2, 1869, in Porbandar, India, a
        seacoast town in the Kathiawar Peninsula north of Bombay, India. His wealthy family
        was from one of the higher castes (Indian social classes). He was the fourth child of
        Karamchand Gandhi, prime minister to the raja (ruler) of three small city-states, and
        Purtlibai, his fourth wife. Gandhi described his mother as a deeply religious woman who
        attended temple (a place for religious worship) service daily. Mohandas was a small,
        quiet boy who disliked sports and was only an average student. At the age of thirteen he
        did not even know in advance that he was to marry Kasturbai, a girl his own age. The
        childhood ambition of Mohandas was to study medicine, but as this was considered
        beneath his caste, his father persuaded him to study law instead. After his marriage
        Mohandas finished high school and tutored his wife.

    <p>In September 1888 Gandhi went to England to study. Before leaving India, he promised
        his mother he would try not to eat meat. He was an even stricter vegetarian while away
        than he had been at home. In England he studied law but never completely adjusted to 
        the English way of life. He became a lawyer in 1891 and sailed for Bombay. He
        attempted unsuccessfully to practice law in Rajkot and Bombay, then for a brief period
        served as lawyer for the prince of Porbandar.
